# PhD-draft-code
Just a repo where I can walk myself through my process 

- Firstly, I need to download my data from here:
``https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/synthetic_dataset/ ``
- Then I need to set up an environment where I can play with my downloaded data

## Installing dependencies on my practice conda environment 

```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy keras
conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision torchaudio
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost lightgbm statsmodels
```

- tensorflow was being weird so i left it for now
